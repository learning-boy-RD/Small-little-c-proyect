# Small-little-cpp-proyect

 This is not a serious proyect, is just to upload little c++ programs to solve little 'problems'... but When i get better in english, javascript/html/css and python (also math and algorithns,datastrucure etc..) I Will dedicate to learn c++(my first and my favorite programing language) a lot better and write programs with it,also i will create a new repository when thats happen to upload better or bigger proyects in c++.
