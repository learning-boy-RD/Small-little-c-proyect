# GetAge

This proyect has finished. The program can tell you an age from the following data: Year,month,and day of birth... if you dont have the day or month the  program can still give you the age but  there is posibility(1/2) that give you the age wrong by one(1) year.
 
 -Compiled for windows with MinGW, you can also compile it for other system.
 
 -GetDate.hpp is a library made by me that have funtions to get the current year, day, or month easier using ctime(http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/)
